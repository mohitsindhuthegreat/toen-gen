# Phantoms JWT Generator

## Overview

The Phantoms JWT Generator is a Flask-based web application that provides JWT token generation services for Garena Free Fire accounts. It supports both single token generation and bulk processing capabilities with a clean web interface and REST API endpoints. Now includes like feature for sending likes to players using generated tokens.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Structure**: Modular design with utilities separated into `/utils` directory
- **Processing**: Synchronous request handling with rate limiting and caching
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and secure file handling

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for interactive features
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Bootstrap components and gradient themes
- **User Interface**: Tab-based navigation for single vs bulk token generation

## Key Components

### Core Application (`app.py`)
- Main Flask application with unified token generation approach
- Middleware configuration (ProxyFix, rate limiting, caching)
- API endpoints: `/api/token` (single), `/api/bulk-token` (bulk), `/api/like` (like system)
- Session management with secure secret key handling

### Token Generation (`utils/token_generator.py`)
- **TokenGenerator class**: Fast Garena API authentication (~0.3s per token)
- **Protocol Buffers**: Uses protobuf for data serialization (my_pb2.py, output_pb2.py)
- **Encryption**: AES encryption with predefined keys for secure token processing
- **External API**: Integrates with Garena's OAuth token grant endpoint

### Like System (`utils/like_service.py`)
- **LikeService class**: Handles like sending with 60 tokens maximum
- **ONE TOKEN PER LIKE**: Each token sends exactly 1 real like for maximum effectiveness
- **Multi-region support**: IND, US, and general endpoints
- **Real-time monitoring**: Success tracking and player verification

### File Processing (`utils/file_processor.py`)
- **FileProcessor class**: Handles bulk credential extraction from uploaded files
- **Supported formats**: JSON and TXT files with multiple credential patterns
- **Pattern matching**: Regex-based extraction for various credential formats
- **Security**: File type validation and secure filename handling

### Web Interface
- **Templates**: Base template with navigation, index page, and API documentation
- **Static assets**: Custom CSS styling and JavaScript for interactive features
- **User experience**: Loading modals, progress indicators, and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **Single Token Generation**:
   - User inputs UID and password via web form
   - Credentials sent to `/api/token` endpoint
   - TokenGenerator authenticates with Garena API
   - JWT token returned to user interface

2. **Bulk Token Processing**:
   - User uploads file containing multiple credentials
   - FileProcessor extracts UID/password pairs using regex patterns
   - Batch processing through TokenGenerator for each credential
   - Results compiled and offered for download

3. **File Download**:
   - Generated tokens stored temporarily
   - ZIP file creation for bulk downloads
   - Secure file serving with proper headers

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework with caching and rate limiting extensions
- **Requests**: HTTP client for Garena API communication
- **PyCryptodome**: AES encryption/decryption functionality
- **Protobuf**: Protocol buffer serialization for data structures

### Security & Performance
- **Flask-Limiter**: Rate limiting (200 requests/day, 50/hour)
- **Flask-Caching**: In-memory caching with SimpleCache backend
- **Werkzeug**: ProxyFix middleware for proper request handling

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive UI framework
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced UI
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity

## Deployment Strategy

### Configuration
- **Environment variables**: Session secret and configuration options
- **Debug mode**: Enabled for development (main.py)
- **Host binding**: Configured for 0.0.0.0:5000

### Static Assets
- **CSS/JS**: Served from static directory
- **Templates**: Jinja2 template rendering
- **File uploads**: Temporary file handling with secure cleanup

### Security Measures
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse with tiered limits
- **Input validation**: Secure filename handling and content validation
- **SSL warnings**: Disabled for specific external API calls
- **CSRF protection**: Session-based security

### Scalability Considerations
- **Caching**: 7-hour cache timeout for performance
- **File processing**: Handles multiple credential formats
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive logging and user feedback
- **Resource management**: Temporary file cleanup and memory management

The application is designed for easy deployment with minimal configuration requirements, focusing on reliability and user experience for JWT token generation workflows.
